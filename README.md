# WaveRD âœ¨

**WaveRD**: is a free online football manager for advanced soccer management. The title of manager is almost exclusively used in British football. In most other European countries in which professional football is played, the person responsible for the direction of a team is awarded the position of coach or "trainer"<br/>
This app was built to meet a true soccer management system where the developers and contributors also play the game.<br/>
I've always had the goal to build a free online soccer app that can compete with **FIFA** and **eFootball**, but then what really pushed/motivated me to start the development of WaveRD, was a question asked on another football manager platform, and the user goes like this '**Does the developers of this game even play it or knows what it looks like?**'<br/>
Initially, **WaveRD** was a closed source app, but my mentor who's a lover of Open Source Community influenced my decision to make it public; such that it will really benefit the software developers community, in a way that new developers and experienced developers can fork the project, tweak it and experiment new features with it.<br/>
That being said **PERMISSION IN NOT GRANTED TO CLONE THIS APP FOR ANY COMMERCIAL GAIN IN ANY FORM NOR DEVIATE FROM IT'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE, NEITHER IS ANYONE ALLOWED TO USE PART/FULL CODEBASE ON ANOTHER PLATFORM WITHOUT EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION FROM ME**

## About WaveRD Serverâš¡

WaveRD Server holds the code necessary for the backend of [WaveRD](https://www.waverd.com), which is an online Soccer Manager App with the main of building an engaging online soccer game with peoples satisfaction as our goal. What motivated me to build WaveRD was the inability for existing Online Manger games to give what we really want in a soccer manager app, after sending mails most platform on how to improve the game, without response, i can across one post where a user asked 'Do the developers of this game even play it, or are they just there for money'.

WaveRD APIs are hosted on **[Render](https://render.com/)**. Though similar in nature, they handle different api request: console | accounts | manager | apihub

| API      | Action                                                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| console  | Handles admin/moderators actions such as logs, contact us, etc.             |
| accounts | Handles actions such as signin, signup, password reset, data deletion, etc. |
| manager  | handles all soccer manager related endpoints                                |
| apihub   | handles all public apihub related endpoints                                 |

## NPM Packages && Services

All packages installed are key to this app running smoothly and we graciously thank the group of developers maintaining those packages. Currently our server is running on a free tier hosted on **RENDER** formerly on _Heroku_ before it's free plan was cancelled and we are working on raising funds to upgrade our server. The following in no particular order executes a very important task on our server.

1. https://console.cron-job.org: Since we run our app on a free tier, cron-job helps to keep our app awake 24hrs.

2. Having our app awake 24hrs, we use cron-job to keep our Tasks up and running which is crucial to the game. such as generating match scores, automatically accepting and sending bids from unmanaged clubs, injuries and fitness, etc.

3. We would be considered greedy and selfish if we fail to mention MongoDB, what is a game without a database, and not just a database, a powerful NoSQL Database.

4. A very important platform worth mentioning and a try for every developer would be be Vercel, that currently maintains next.js, offers a way for us to manage our domain across services, provides free hosting and an excellent support.

## Getting Started

1. _Fork_ **WaveRD Server** [here](https://github.com/Chukwu3meka/waverd-server) and clone your remote branch.
2. If you don't have a gitignore file, you can create one and [run](https://sigalambigha.home.blog/2020/03/11/how-to-refresh-gitignore/) `git rm -r --cached .` to ensure git is tracking the right file, i.e files not listed in the new _.gitignore_
3. You need to clone the waverd-gateway [repo](https://github.com/Chukwu3meka/waverd-gateway) to proceed, gateway allows client and server to run on the same port during development.
4. If you maintain the same folder name after cloning waverd-gateway, no extra step is required.
   > ~~else; Ensure to update the gateway path in `ecosystem.config.js` to match cloned path of waverd-gateway.~~
5. .env file is required to proceed, a list of required variables can be found in the app index.
6. In development we run a few command to reflect changes on file change since we are using TypeScript, and to keep our app running all the time. ~~To simplify the process we created a bash file to handle this~~

   > ~~Make sure to install pm2 `npm install pm2 -g`~~ > ~~Run `bash dev.sh` to start our development server and compile TS to JS in the dist folder in realtime.~~

   > To simply this simply start the gateway manually and also run `npm start` to start our server

7. Make sure to use `node` as environment, `yarn` as build command and `npm start` to start app in render
8. To verify build status locally, run `npx tsc`.
9. Happy hacking...ðŸ˜‰
